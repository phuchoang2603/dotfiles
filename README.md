# Dotfiles Setup

This repository contains my personal dotfiles setup.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phuchoang2603/dotfiles.git
   ```

2. Run the symlink script to set up the dotfiles:

   ```bash
   ./symlink.sh
   ```

## Dry Run

To preview the changes without applying them, use the `--dry-run` option:

```bash
./symlink.sh --dry-run
```

That's it! Your dotfiles are now set up.
